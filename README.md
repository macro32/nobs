No Bad Sectors - a MSDOS disc editor written in assembler

Written at the time I was working exlusively in assembler using the DEC assemblers MACRO-10, MACRO-11, MACRO-32, as well as MASM the 8086 assembler which built this program, and MAC, the 8085 assembler. This program edits a floppy disc under early versions of MSDOS. The machine it was written for was a dual processor (8085 and 8088) Zenith Z100. It came with its own version of MSDOS known as ZDOS.

I wrote a suite of programs to do various useful tasks with MSDOS but I could not get support to commercialise them. Otherwise you would be talking about the Ratcliffe Utilities and not the Norton Utilities.

All programs written had to start with an 'N' for North London Polytechnic. The name fitted this convention and was also a good description of function. It had the added benefit of being able to say 'This disc has nobs on.' It amused me at the time and still makes me smile. Little things....
